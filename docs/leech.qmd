## Lobbying


~~direct contacts of legislators by interest group representatives aimed at persuasion~~ $\rightarrow$ "all actions of interest groups that are aimed at influencing public policy"

- funding (e.g., PACs)
- by providing information (signals) about constituency preferences
- mobilize constituencies in support or opposition to a candidate
- providing information, mobilizing publics, attracting media attention, and generally subsidizing the activities of government officials

## Influence 


- Votes and changes in final policy text 

  - floor votes in Congress, final decisions in bureaucratic rule making, or court rulings

- But also

  - changing *the way an issue is talked about*
  - gaining *access* to members of government
  - getting an issue on the *agenda*
  - getting members of government *active* on an issue


## Why don't political scientists know what is going on?

Variables operating along side lobbying

- visibility
- technicality
- partisanship
- salience of the issue
- how costs and benefits were distributed
- the degree of organized opposition
- electoral variables
- public opinion
- etc.


## Why don't political scientists know what is going on?

Causality is complex

- groups repeat the same arguments
- groups lobby when they think they can win
- etc.

## What do political scientists do wrong?

- select on the dependent variable
- focus on the end stage of the policy process
- ask yes/no questions
- misunderstand what it is that interest groups actually do
- misunderstand how the policy process actually works
   - rarely focus on agendas and policy formation
   - focus on Congress

## What do political scientists do wrong?

> Thousands of bills are introduced each year in Congress, thousands of petitioners appeal to the court system, and there is a virtually unlimited range of issues on which an agency might decide to create a rule. With the exception of studies of agenda setting in the Supreme Court, however, too little work has been done on interest group efforts to affect the agendas of these decision-making bodies

## What do we know? 

-  interest group lobbyists spend far more time talking with policymakers who agree with them than those who disagree with them 
  - lobbying as subsidy---interest groups provide information, facts, supporters, media coverage, or strategic expertise (not just money and meetings)
- lobbying is often opposed
- lobbying to stop change is easier
- lobbying unopposed is most effective, especially if the broader political context is favorable
- coalitions are often diverse
