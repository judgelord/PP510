## Lobbying


~~direct contacts of legislators by interest group representatives aimed at persuasion~~ $\rightarrow$ "all actions of interest groups that are aimed at influencing public policy"

## Influence 


- Votes and changes in final policy text 

  - floor votes in Congress, final decisions in bureaucratic rule making, or court rulings

- But also

  - changing *the way an issue is talked about*
  - gaining *access* to members of government
  - getting an issue on the *agenda*
  - getting members of government *active* on an issue


## Why don't political scientists know what is going on?

Other variables

- visibility
- technicality
- partisanship
- salience of the issue
- how costs and benefits were distributed
- the degree of organized opposition
- electoral variables
- public opinion
- etc.

## What do political scientists do wrong?

- select on the dependent variable
- focus on the end stage of the policy process
- misunderstand what it is that interest groups actually do
- misunderstand how the policy process actually works
