> Political conflict is not like an intercollegiate debate in which the opponents agree in advance on a definition of the issues. As a matter of fact, the definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power; antagonists can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition. 

> He who determines what politics is about runs the country, because the definition of alternatives is the choice of conflicts, and the choice of conflicts allocates power.

-- E. E. Schattschneider, The Semisovereign People (1975)

## Marriage Equality

## Lessons 

Politics as outcome

> There is more to being a successful social movement than winning immediate or direct favorable outcomes 

Discourse as mechanism of 

> without a ready-made apparatus of Washington-based interest organizations or routine access to elected officials *must* go through the pubic sphere...to communicate the definition of the problem they see and the contours of the "common-sense" logic that leads them to their preffered solutions.

(problem definition and analysis)


## Political acceptance

- covered by the media 
- addressed by elected officials 
- opponents must begin talking about the issue, taking into account the way challengers have framed the debate
