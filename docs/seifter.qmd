## Administrative Law

Policy that governs agencies

- Your state-level policy recommendations are all #AdLaw

- Legislation instructing agencies to do things, especially processes they must follow 

- Agency rules, processes, and other interpretations of their statutory authority

-  Court opinions on all of the above, as well as on constitutional issues relating to agency actions, appointments, and policymaking

- Does not include criminal law, property law, contract law, or liability law, except to the extent that agencies define, adjudicate, or enforce such laws (which they often do)

## Editoral 

*While Seifter focuses on administrative law, the core insight applies to all forms of public participation, including legislative lobbying, town halls, public hearings, stakeholder processes, amicus briefs, etc. IMHO.

## First-order participation 

> "the engagement by interested parties in the many avenues for public involvement in policymaking."

Celebrated as democratic 

- Used to justify policymaking by unelected agency officials 

Interest groups dominate

- meeting with and lobbying agency officials
- commenting on rules
- petitioning for agency action
- setting standards that agencies adopt as rules
- filing and settling lawsuits against agencies

## Praise for first-order participation 

- fosters democracy
- checks government power
- enhances agency expertise
- enriches civic experience

. . . 

*Descriptive and normative claims, both more aligned with pluralism than elite theories

# Second-order participation 

Are organized groups effective or ineffective representatives? 

## Seifter's argument 

Public participation in policymaking is often seen as key to democracy. 

. . .

But, because organized groups dominate public participation, the value of participation __also depends on democracy *within* interest groups__. 

. . . 

Thus, a close study of interest groups is essential to understanding or reforming public participation processes.

# I. The intersection of first- and second-order participation

## The intersection 

- fosters democracy
  - or do groups speak only for a select few? 
- checks government power
  - or do groups use participatory processes to hinder government power? 
- enhances agency expertise
  - or do groups mislead by pretending to have expertise? 
- enriches civic experience
  - or do groups hinder individual engagement? 
  

## Organized groups 

Many are governed by various aspects of nonprofit law: 

- trade associations
- chambers of commerce
- public interest groups, 
- think tanks
- unions 

. . . 

*Seifter does not consider individual companies to be interest groups, but I think her argument applies just as well to them

## Organized groups

- Lifeblood of politics
- Wide spectrum of internal governance rules
  - Member involvement varies
  - Some have no members at all
- Seldom transparent 

. . . 

> "The most effective lobbyists tend to have less internal participation."

> "Engaging with members can impede a group’s ability to take focused positions, to act quickly, and to appeal to donors" (1305)

# II. Understanding Second-Order Participation

## Voice and Exit

> [Policymakers] did not find it necessary to impose any specific representational obligations on groups because it is assumed that, in order to survive, an organization must effectively represent the interests of a substantial proportion of its members, and that any member who objects strenuously to the representation afforded can resign. (1333)

##  Interest groups fuel the myth of representation

> The claim to speak for a constituency---sometimes a numerous or powerful constituency---is often an interest group’s strongest currency. (1333)

## Varieties of second-order participation

- no members (e.g., thinktanks, many advocacy groups, especially astroturf ones)
- unstructured participation (e.g., Chambers of Commerce, AARP, most nonprofits with a self-perpetuating leadership, many churches)
- election-based participation (e.g., unions, Sierra Club chapters, many clubs and associations, many churches)
- issue-based participation (e.g., ad hoc groups of state officials, League of Women Voters, change.org petitions)

## Beyond membership

Who else might a group speak for, and what biases may shape the group’s contributions? 

- Funding structure and major donors
- The role of funders in governance 
- Dissent with the organization



# III. Implications 

## What do we do? 

1. Require second-order participation 

2. Require disclosure of second-order participation
