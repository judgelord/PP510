## Administrative Law

Policy that governs agencies

- Your state-level policy recommendations are all #adlaw

- Legislation instructing agencies to do things, especially processes they must follow 

- Agency rules, processes, and other interpretations of their statutory authority

-  Court opinions on all of the above, as well as on constitutional issues relating to agency actions, appointments, and policymaking

- Does not include criminal law, property law, contract law, liability law, except to the extent that agencies define, adjudicate, or enforce such laws (which they often do)

## First-order participation 



## Second-order participation 


## Argument 

Public participation in policymaking is often seen as key to democracy. 

. . .

BUT, because organized groups dominate public participation, the value of participation __also depends on democracy *within* interest groups__. 

. . . 

THUS, a close study of interest groups is essential to understanding or reforming, public participation processes.

## Organized groups

- Lifeblood of politics
- Wide spectrum of internal governance rules
  - Member involvement varies
  - Some have no members at all
- Seldom transparent 

. . . 

> "the most effective lobbyists tending to have less internal participation"
