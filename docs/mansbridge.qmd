## Clarifying the Concept of Representation

- Both Rehfeld and Mansbridge think that the classic trustee/delegate model is too simple
- Mansbridge argues that concepts of representation must cover individual representation _and_ **systems of representation**
  - Thus, gyroscopic and surrogate representation are helpful ways to evaluate representative **systems**, not just representatives
  - Without the concept of surrogate representation, we can't think about the role of interest groups in a democracy

## Questions 



> How do lawmakers make sense of the notion that they are to use their own best judgment in their jobs while being responsive to the desires of the public? - Tierra

. . . 

> <!--I do wonder if her selection model is the most applicable one at the presidential level when there is such diversity in voters that it seems like people do care about whether or not a candidate aligns with their specific stance on issues?--> Would Mansbridge say that voters are still placing importance on their belief in the candidate's ability to exercise independent judgment, or would she say that specific issues are what drives voters? <!--Would she argue that a selection model is always implicit?--> - Amaya



> <!--For the most part, people want to see a representative with a coherent, consistent personality more than they want to see someone who is swayed by external forces, even when the external force in question is popular opinion. If this kind of responsiveness is not very valuable to constituents, is there any kind of back-and-forth relationship they want with their representative aside from the opportunity to re-elect them or not every few years? -->Are there any circumstances where issue alignment does become more important than internal/intrinsic motivations? - Rebecca
