## Agendas and Democratic Politics


The agenda

- a menu of final policy choices
- the most important problems 
- <mark>the shortlist of the possible</mark>
  - the set of things open to public contestation
  - “what politics is” (Schattschneider 1975)
  - “common sense.” (Woodly 2015)
    - what is acceptable 
    - how to think about problems

> The definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power; the antagonist can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition. 

>He who determines what politics is runs the country, because the definition of alternatives is the choice of conflicts, and the choice of conflicts allocates power.

-- E. E. Schattschneider, The Semisovereign People (1975)

## Policy agenda research


How the agenda is limited, often by elites or attention dynamics 

   - limiting [the scope of conflict]() (Schattschneider 1975)
   
   Bounded rationality
   
   1. limiting [the scope of attention]()---"the second face of power" (Bachrach and Baratz 1962)
   2. "the [premises]() of decision-making" (Simon 1976)
   
   Agenda control 
   
   - [negative agenda power]()  (e.g., Cox and McCubbins 1993, "procedural cartel" model of Congress)

## limiting the scope of conflicts

Defining appropriate spheres 

- better left to the individual
- better left to the family 
- better left to the market
- better left to experts

---

## Problem definitions and public meaning

The premises of decision-making + the scope *and meaning* of conflicts

> If a problem is an "environmental" issue does it implicate efficiency questions, questions of the common good, or matters of justice? Why?

## The set of people

# Implications

> We have missed the normative and equity dimensions.

Take for grated who the players are

> We have ignored fundamental mechanisms of transformational change in institutions and policies.

Sufferage

> We have excluded central processes in the generation and maintenance of political and economic inequality.


**How** are things are excluded from being “political” or eligible for political disputation and problem-solving?

The structure of policymaking institutions and advocacy organizations shapes agenda setting because *all* organizations systematically privilege some issues/ideas/conflicts/solutions over others.  

> "All forms of political organization have a bias in favor of the exploitation of some kinds of conflict and the suppression of others because *organization is the mobilization of bias*. Some issues are organized into politics, while others are organized out." - E. E. Schattshneider

Legislators receiving more support from business and other wealthy interests were more likely to discuss upper-class priorities.

Why did many states advance the same proposals at the same time?

### Political intermediaries

- protest campaigns
- social organizations
- advocacy campaigns
- grievance mechanisms

###  Intersections of state and society 

- petitioning
- complaint-making
- public comment
- hearings


## (potentially) Agenda-democratizing processes and institutions {.nonincremental}

::: {.nonincremental}
- petitions
- protests
- advocacy campaigns 
- organized political collectives (e.g., labor unions)
- non-electoral elite interventions (e.g., courts)
:::
Many begin as attempts to address issues of non-democracy in agenda setting, but campaigns may also be illiberal or anti-democratic.



## Success 

“success” of these campaigns should consider not merely whether they changed policy or laws in the short run, but whether they shifted agendas and discourse 

---

## Equality 

Equality in lawmaking 

vs.

Equality in deliberation and voice
