The Policy Process

---

| Public Policy | Author |
|: --- |: --- |
|"the actions of government and the intentions that determine those actions" | Cochran et al. (2010) |
| "the outcome of the struggle in government of who gets what" | Cochran et al. (2010) citing Lasswell's (1936) definition of politics as the struggle over "who gets what, when, and how" |
| "whatever governments choose to do of not to do" | Dye (2013) |
| "political decisions for implementing programs to achieve societal goals" | Cochran and Malone (2010) |
| the sum of government activity, whether acting directly or through agents" | Peters (2010) | 
| "statements by government of what it intends to do...the lack of such statements may also be an *implicit* statement of policy" | Birkland (2020) |
| "texts, practices, and symbols, and discourses that define and deliver values" | Schneider and Ingram (1997) | 

---

## "Implicit" Policy - Rights  
Unlike some countries, the US Constitution and law does not explicitly guarantee rights such as healthcare, housing, a living wage. Such ommissions imply a policy of not guaranteeing such rights.

--

> In *Juliana, et al. v. United States*, plaintiffs argued that the federal government is violating their right to life and liberty.
While the ninth circuit panel found the government is violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, two of the three judges said that the requested remedies should be addressed by the executive and legislative branches.

--

The *Public Trust Doctrine* and other *common law* doctrines are rooted in rights claims.

(More on rights as policy and the role of rights claims in policymaking in Stone, Chapter 15) 

---

## "Implicit" Policy - Practices  
- "street-level bureaucrats" such as teachers, election officials, police officers (Lipsky 2010) 

---

## "Explicit" policy

--

- Constitution
- Statute  
- Rule  
- Court precedent  
- Executive order
- Budget
- etc.

---

## The Policy Process 

problem definition -> agenda setting -> policy making -> implimentation

(or something like this)
---

## Policy analysis vs. policy studies

> *Policy analysis* tends to concentrate on the formal evaluation or estimation of "policy impacts" or outcomes, usually by using quantitative techniques such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or risk assessment and managment...*Policy studies*, on the other hand, are broader in scope, examining not just individual programs and their effects, but also their causes and presuppositions, and the processes that led to their adoption. (Howlett, Ramesh, and Pearl, 2009)

- *Policy analysis* is what we do when writing a policy memo (see Weimer and Vining 2017 and Bardach and Patashnik 2016)  
- *Policy studies* is what we do in class 


---

## Democracy and technocracy

Machiavelli's *The Prince* 

Enlightenment social philosophies based on reason (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu)

**Technocracy** A system of government characterized by high reliance on a small elite of technical experts, whose decisions about public policy are more influential than the desires of citizens. 

---

## Classical liberalism 

> The ideological system that emphasizes individual liberty and the ownership and acquisition of private property as a means to improve society's wealth and discourage social strife. 

See John Locke's *Second Treatise of Civil Government* (1690) 

Influential among the framers, especially anti-federalists (see the 5th Amendment). 

---

## The Public Interest

> The *assumed* broader desires or needs of the public, in whose name policy is made. The public interest is hard to define but is something to which all policy advocates appeal.

---

## Politics 

- the process by which a society determines who gets, what, when, and how (critiqued as implying zero-sum)  

- the art or science of government 

- collective action (politics and policy as a means to net benefits)  

- participation in civic life (Dewey and Rogers 2016, Stone 2012)

- "playing politics" and "political hobbyism" [(Hersh 2020)](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/political-hobbyists-are-ruining-politics/605212/)

---

## Problem

> A usually undesirable situation that, some assert, can be alleviated by government action.

---

## Evidence

> Listen: [Moonshots-Thomas Kalil](https://scholars.org/podcast/moonshots)

> Listen: [Informing Policy-Jenni W. Owen](https://scholars.org/podcast/informing-policy)

Where policy priorities come from: 
- Policymakers  
- Crises - "focusing events" (e.g. Ebola)
- Advisory committees 
- Institutions designed to inform policy like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), and Government Accountability Office (GAO) and research arms of executive agencies (DARPA, ARS, CEQ, etc.).

---

## Bureaucracy 

If you care about implementation, you need support from the bottom as well as the top  
- "we bes" can "slow roll" or "fast track" (Potter 2017)

The Policy Environment

---

## The Structural Environment 

- Separation of Powers

- Federalism

- *Substantive policies*: A policy that explains how the government will go about its policy goals in a particular area.

- *Procedural policies* (e.g., Administrative Procedures Act)

- *Transparency requirements* (Open public meetings laws, Freedom of Information Act)

---

## The Socio-economic Environment 

Demographics (population age, gender, race, class, etc.)

???

As I said, I chose this book because it is an excellent overview of the field. It is not a critical perspective of the filed. 
You may have noticed that he sometimes says "we" and "people" and "Americans" and "our national experience" when he means "White Americans" and "those people" and "their cultures" when he refers to people who are not White. 

Surely I am part of this as well. I know often say things like "the kind of people who are on the supreme court" rather than "old white men born to wealthy families that got them into prestigious law schools"--this probably obscures what is going on. Still, honestly, that is a mouthful, and I trust you to know what I mean.

## Inputs to judicial-branch policymaking

In selecting cases ("granting *cert.*")
- *Original jurisdiction*
- *Circuit splits* (where a court has *appellate jurisdiction*)
- *Test cases*, where [*“legal entrepreneurs”*](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/architect-edward-blum) recruit sympathetic plaintiffs to change precedent

In each case 
- briefs (plaintiff, respondent, Solicitor General, amicus)
- arguments (plaintiff, respondent and their designees)

Public opinion


---

## Outputs

**statute laws**: Laws made by the legislature and signed by the executive, generally codified into *The U.S. Code (e.g., Title 5 U.S. Code § 706)* or state codes. 

**administrative rules**: Often called regulations, but also include funding criteria, deregulatory policy, and many other kinds of policy. They usually have the force of law, are published in the *Federal Register (FR)*, and are codified in the *Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)* or state registers and codes (unlike informal *guidance*).

**case law**: ~~Laws that are made~~ *Interpretations of laws* as a result of judicial decisions that influence future decisions, called *legal precedent.*

Voters in districts with less campaign coverage were less able to evaluate their House incumbent and not as capable of identifying the candidates vying for office as liberal or conservative. They were also less likely to report that they planned to vote in the House election.

# Agenda Setting

**Agenda setting:** The process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention (including the activities or actors to prevent problems or solutions from gaining attention)



![](figs/agendas.jpg)

---

**Enactment:** The act of putting a decision, such as legislation or regulation, into effect. Statues are generally enacted in the United States when the President or governor signs a bill or when a legislature overrides their veto. Agency rules are enacted when published as "final rules" (vs. draft rules). 

![](figs/tsa.jpg)

---

The structure of policymaking institutions and advocacy organizations shapes agenda setting because *all* organizations systematically privilege some issues/ideas/conflicts/solutions over others.  

> "All forms of political organization have a bias in favor of the exploitation of some kinds of conflict and the suppression of others because *organization is the mobilization of bias*. Some issues are organized into politics, while others are organized out." - E. E. Schattshneider

---

Fully comprehensive and "rational" agenda-setting is unrealistic. 

**Garbage can model:** A model of decision-making developed by Cohen, March, and Olsen, who argue that organizations are "organized anarchies" and make decisions based on the flow of problems, solutions, and participants into the choice opportunities they call "garbage cans." This is the foundation of Kingdon's Multiple Streams metaphor. 

--

![](figs/trash.jpg) ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/QLyhWVTvAHbAbAdWcp/giphy.gif)

---

**Window of Opportunity:** The point in time at which policy change becomes more likely (from Kingdon's streams metaphor)

![](figs/kingdon-streams.jpg)

---

"Problem streams" and "political streams" may change rapidly due to a **focusing event:** A sudden event that can generate attention to public problems or issues, particularly issues and problems that are actually or potentially harmful. 

The resulting pattern of policymaking is often called **punctuated equilibrium**.

# Elite Theory v. Pluralism

**Group theories** of the relationship between political actors and policy outcomes.

**Pluralism:** Policy results from many groups competing and negotiating with each other in a relatively open political system.

**Elite theory:** Policy results from negotiations among a relatively closed network of elites--those with high social status (elite educational credentials, wealth, etc.).

 *Who Governs?* by Robert A. Dahl vs. *The Power Elite* by C. Wright Mills (building on Max Weber)
 
These theories may be stated normatively (policymaking ought to be pluralist) or positively (policymaking is pluralist). Empirically, pluralism focuses more on behavior, elite theory more on structure.
