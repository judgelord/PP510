## Policy analysis vs. policy studies

> *Policy analysis* tends to concentrate on the formal evaluation or estimation of "policy impacts" or outcomes, usually by using quantitative techniques such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or risk assessment and managment...*Policy studies*, on the other hand, are broader in scope, examining not just individual programs and their effects, but also their causes and presuppositions, and the processes that led to their adoption. (Howlett, Ramesh, and Pearl, 2009)

- *Policy analysis* is what we do when writing a policy memo (see Weimer and Vining 2017 and Bardach and Patashnik 2016)  
- *Policy studies* is what we do in class

## Democracy and technocracy

Machiavelli's *The Prince* 

Enlightenment social philosophies based on reason (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu)

**Technocracy** A system of government characterized by high reliance on a small elite of technical experts, whose decisions about public policy are more influential than the desires of citizens. 

---

## Classical liberalism 

> The ideological system that emphasizes individual liberty and the ownership and acquisition of private property as a means to improve society's wealth and discourage social strife. 

See John Locke's *Second Treatise of Civil Government* (1690) 

Influential among the framers, especially anti-federalists (see the 5th Amendment). 

---

## The Public Interest

> The *assumed* broader desires or needs of the public, in whose name policy is made. The public interest is hard to define but is something to which all policy advocates appeal.

---

## Problem

> A usually undesirable situation that, some assert, can be alleviated by government action.

## Bureaucracy 

If you care about implementation, you need support from the bottom as well as the top  
- "we bes" can "slow roll" or "fast track" (Potter 2017)

## Inputs to judicial-branch policymaking

In selecting cases ("granting *cert.*")
- *Original jurisdiction*
- *Circuit splits* (where a court has *appellate jurisdiction*)
- *Test cases*, where [*“legal entrepreneurs”*](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/architect-edward-blum) recruit sympathetic plaintiffs to change precedent

In each case 
- briefs (plaintiff, respondent, Solicitor General, amicus)
- arguments (plaintiff, respondent and their designees)

The legal profession
- Law Review articles 

Public opinion


---

## Outputs

**statute laws**: Laws made by the legislature and signed by the executive, generally codified into *The U.S. Code (e.g., Title 5 U.S. Code § 706)* or state codes. 

**administrative rules**: Often called regulations, but also include funding criteria, deregulatory policy, and many other kinds of policy. They usually have the force of law, are published in the *Federal Register (FR)*, and are codified in the *Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)* or state registers and codes (unlike informal *guidance*).

**case law**: ~~Laws that are made~~ *Interpretations of laws* as a result of judicial decisions that influence future decisions, called *legal precedent.*

---

### Legislative outputs (p. 117)

- Bills (including authorizations and appropriations)
- Joint resolutions
- Concurrent resolutions
