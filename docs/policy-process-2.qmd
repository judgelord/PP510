## Policy analysis vs. policy studies

> *Policy analysis* tends to concentrate on the formal evaluation or estimation of "policy impacts" or outcomes, usually by using quantitative techniques such as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or risk assessment and managment...*Policy studies*, on the other hand, are broader in scope, examining not just individual programs and their effects, but also their causes and presuppositions, and the processes that led to their adoption. (Howlett, Ramesh, and Pearl, 2009)

- *Policy analysis* is what we do when writing a policy memo (see Weimer and Vining 2017 and Bardach and Patashnik 2016)  
- *Policy studies* is what we do in class

## Democracy and technocracy

Machiavelli's *The Prince* 

Enlightenment social philosophies based on reason (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu)

**Technocracy** A system of government characterized by high reliance on a small elite of technical experts, whose decisions about public policy are more influential than the desires of citizens. 

---

## Classical liberalism 

> The ideological system that emphasizes individual liberty and the ownership and acquisition of private property as a means to improve society's wealth and discourage social strife. 

See John Locke's *Second Treatise of Civil Government* (1690) 

Influential among the framers, especially anti-federalists (see the 5th Amendment). 

---

## The Public Interest

> The *assumed* broader desires or needs of the public, in whose name policy is made. The public interest is hard to define but is something to which all policy advocates appeal.

---

## Problem

> A usually undesirable situation that, some assert, can be alleviated by government action.

---

## Evidence

> Listen: [Moonshots-Thomas Kalil](https://scholars.org/podcast/moonshots)

> Listen: [Informing Policy-Jenni W. Owen](https://scholars.org/podcast/informing-policy)


---

## Bureaucracy 

If you care about implementation, you need support from the bottom as well as the top  
- "we bes" can "slow roll" or "fast track" (Potter 2017)

## Input-Output Model of Policymaking

---

## Inputs to legislative-branch policymaking

- Casework (constituents)  
- Experts, including CBO, GAO, CRS, and advisory panels
- Interest group pressure campaigns (constituents and non-constituents)  
- Media (often informed by experts or pressure campaigns)
- The threat of presidential veto or pocket veto
- The threat of judicial review

## Inputs to judicial-branch policymaking

In selecting cases ("granting *cert.*")
- *Original jurisdiction*
- *Circuit splits* (where a court has *appellate jurisdiction*)
- *Test cases*, where [*“legal entrepreneurs”*](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect/episodes/architect-edward-blum) recruit sympathetic plaintiffs to change precedent

In each case 
- briefs (plaintiff, respondent, Solicitor General, amicus)
- arguments (plaintiff, respondent and their designees)

The legal profession
- Law Review articles 

Public opinion


---

## Outputs

**statute laws**: Laws made by the legislature and signed by the executive, generally codified into *The U.S. Code (e.g., Title 5 U.S. Code § 706)* or state codes. 

**administrative rules**: Often called regulations, but also include funding criteria, deregulatory policy, and many other kinds of policy. They usually have the force of law, are published in the *Federal Register (FR)*, and are codified in the *Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)* or state registers and codes (unlike informal *guidance*).

**case law**: ~~Laws that are made~~ *Interpretations of laws* as a result of judicial decisions that influence future decisions, called *legal precedent.*

---

### Legislative outputs (p. 117)

- Bills (including authorizations and appropriations)
- Joint resolutions
- Concurrent resolutions

When newspapers close, voters have less information.

- [Split ticket decreases by ~2%](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/6/1007/5160090)
- [Civic participation decreases](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.762817)



[Fewer local reporters](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/newspapers/) lead to [fewer candidates and less competitive elections](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1078087419838058?casa_token=M3-Rd_xUuhgAAAAA%3AMouibGXaJDk1CUpD5rdSeWUAjjtAlEl2OtqM0cV-_nFZz02CgYanxv71WAJOcZKvKJaGWTaCv1Ys&), and a [shift in focus from policy and institutions to "city life"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/damaged-newspapers-damaged-civic-life-how-the-gutting-of-local-newsrooms-has-led-to-a-less-informed-public/)

Voters in districts with less campaign coverage were less able to evaluate their House incumbent and not as capable of identifying the candidates vying for office as liberal or conservative. They were also less likely to report that they planned to vote in the House election.

# Elite Theory v. Pluralism

**Group theories** of the relationship between political actors and policy outcomes.

---

**Pluralism:** Policy results from many groups competing and negotiating with each other in a relatively open political system.

**Elite theory:** Policy results from negotiations among a relatively closed network of elites--those with high social status (elite educational credentials, wealth, etc.).

 *Who Governs?* by Robert A. Dahl vs. *The Power Elite* by C. Wright Mills (building on Max Weber)
 
These theories may also be stated normatively (policymaking ought to be pluralist) or positively (policymaking is pluralist). Empirically, pluralism focuses more on behavior, elite theory more on structure.
