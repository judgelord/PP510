### The press

When newspapers close, voters have less information.

- [Turnout decreases by ~8%](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1078087409351947), [(one additional paper increases turnout by ~.3%, and, among readers, incrases turnout by 13%)](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/voting.pdf)
- [Split ticket decreases by ~2%](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/6/1007/5160090)
- [Civic participation decreases](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.762817)



[Fewer local reporters](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/newspapers/) lead to [fewer candidates and less competitive elections](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1078087419838058?casa_token=M3-Rd_xUuhgAAAAA%3AMouibGXaJDk1CUpD5rdSeWUAjjtAlEl2OtqM0cV-_nFZz02CgYanxv71WAJOcZKvKJaGWTaCv1Ys&), and a [shift in focus from policy and institutions to "city life"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/damaged-newspapers-damaged-civic-life-how-the-gutting-of-local-newsrooms-has-led-to-a-less-informed-public/)

Voters in districts with less campaign coverage were less able to evaluate their House incumbent and not as capable of identifying the candidates vying for office as liberal or conservative. They were also less likely to report that they planned to vote in the House election.

# Elite Theory v. Pluralism

**Group theories** of the relationship between political actors and policy outcomes.

---

**Pluralism:** Policy results from many groups competing and negotiating with each other in a relatively open political system.

**Elite theory:** Policy results from negotiations among a relatively closed network of elites--those with high social status (elite educational credentials, wealth, etc.).

 *Who Governs?* by Robert A. Dahl vs. *The Power Elite* by C. Wright Mills (building on Max Weber)
 
These theories may also be stated normatively (policymaking ought to be pluralist) or positively (policymaking is pluralist). Empirically, pluralism focuses more on behavior, elite theory more on structure.

The likelihood that a policy change will be made is correlated with the preferences of high-income individuals (controlling for the preferences of low-income individuals), but the reverse is not true.
