## [*Rapanos*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-1034) 4-1-4 split (2006)

- Four justices for "do nothing" and let stand the Army Corps "hydrological connection" test  
- Justice Kennedy for a new (more limited?) "significant nexus" test  
- Four justices for a new (much much much more limited) "permanent surface waters only" test

- Kennedy joined the "surface waters only" justices in *judgment* (ruling for Mr. Rapanos) but did not join their opinion, making it a *plurality opinion* not a *majority opinion* and thus not *precidental*---i.e., not binding policy (sort of).
