<!-- Welcome to Introduction to Public Policy. My aim for today is for you all to be clear about the goals and requirements for this class; If we have time, we will start on the topic of Federalism and the U.S. Constitution. This is my first time teaching this class, but I taught a similar class at the University of Wisconsin for 5 years. Each semester we ground our studies in a theme. This semester it will be water quality issues in the Great Lakes region, especially local watersheds and municipal water infrastructure. I chose this because it is important and aligns with my professional policy experience. 

I grew up on a small farm in central Wisconsin, where rainfall and groundwater make all the difference. Did anyone else grow up on a farm? A diary? Does anyone have hogs? 

After college, I worked in local government. Specifically, I worked on regulatory affairs for wastewater treatment facilities. Working in a sewage treatment plant may not sound like the most glamorous work, but we were a major regulated entity, i.e., a major source of pollution, and as such, we were a key stakeholder, which gave me a seat at the table with state and federal agencies in charge of water quality regulations. I helped revise some of those regulations and even wrote pieces of state legislation. 

I went on to do a joint master's in law and environmental science between Yale Law School and Foresty School (Which is really more of a policy school).

Then I went to the UN for a few years. Comparing forestry laws around the world for the Food and Agriculture Organization. The UN does great work, and in some ways is really inspiring, but the slow pace and rampant censorship left me very frustrated, so I came back for my PhD

Five years later, I am working on a book about whether regular people's voices matter in government--that is if policymakers act differently when lots of people are paying attention versus when they are not. I also have major research projects looking at the role of money in politics, which members of Congress really work for behind the scenes, federal budgeting, and forms of non-governmental regulation.

## Overview 

Public policy is defined in many ways.  I think of public policy as the government’s statement of what it intends to do. The government part makes it public, and the stated course of action makes it policy. Policy is more than a single decision, it is a statement about how future decisions will be made. Public policy is made at the international, national, state, regional, county, city, and even more local levels.  

Learning about public policy---what it is, the legal frameworks within which it is made, the tools available to policymakers, the policymaking process, and how to evaluate public policies---will strengthen your writing, analytical, research, and advocacy skills, and will inform your participation in our society. 

---

Public policy is inexorably linked to questions of power. Policy emerges from and shapes politics, but it also involves evidence. Political debates define problems, goals, and agendas, but to achieve any goal through policy, evidence about the effects of different policy tools is indispensable. Evidence must come from sources that your audience will trust. Good evidence ought to be convincing to reasonable opponents of one's policy goals. Good arguments clarify your logic, even to those who may oppose your goals.

---

## Required Texts

Two texts are on reserve at the Library. **Any edition is fine**, but more recent editions have more contemporary examples. I will post other readings on Canvass or the class website.

> Dan Egan, *The Death and Life of the Great Lakes* 

<!-- Thomas A. Birkland, *An Introduction to the Policy Process:  Theories, Concepts, and Models of Public Policy Making*. Any Edition (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe). --> 

> Deborah Stone, *Policy Paradox:  The Art of Political Decision Making*. Any Edition (New York:  W.W. Norton and Co.).


---

## #Goals

1. Engage with public policy scholars and practitioners
1. Understand the history and language of policy studies (Birkland)
1. Understand how scholarly and public debates inform policy (Stone)
1. Conduct policy-relevant research
1. Write for a policy audience
1. Engage in public policymaking
1. Engaging others in the policy process


---

> "Practical wisdom includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience" - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics


<!-- Really there are three kinds of knowledge. 
1. key terms -- I want you to be able to converse with policy scholars and practitioners - talk the talk
2. practice influencing policy
3. see-through public debates to underlying policy conflicts and see the underlying debates that underly policy conflicts

I think the most interesting questions are those without clear answers, so most of the questions I will ask in class are open--no wrong answers. The same is true for your memos--good research and good arguments, not right or wrong conclusions.

However, standardization is important, so the Final exam will test book knowledge, more on that in a minute.

### Learning Outcomes

My objective in teaching this course is to encourage your understanding of the policy-making process in the United States.

- You will understand the provisions of the United States Constitution most related to the development and execution of public policy in the United States: Delegation of powers, separation of powers, federalism, and the allocation of powers within the states.
- You will understand the difference between federalism and the allocation of authorities between state, county, and municipal governments.
- You will learn to define and frame problems as an essential first step in the development of public policy.

---

- You will learn to develop, analyze, and advocate policy alternatives.
- You will learn how to write a policy memo.
- You will learn about executive, administrative, legislative, judicial, and other governmental authorities and their respective roles in making public policy.
- You will understand the role of politics in policy development.
- You will learn various approaches to policy analysis.
- You will learn about different tools and functions available to public policy-makers.
- You will learn various approaches to evaluate the success of public policy initiatives.
- You will learn about the role of norms and values in public policy formulation.

No screens in class (unless I give permission). Research shows that they inhibit learning and distract your colleagues.

## Requirements

### Attendance

Class attendance is required.  I will take attendance at the beginning of each class. If you are going to miss class, please notify me by email in advance. 

<!-- otherwise, I'll be looking for you. 
In part, this is an accountability mechanism, but it is also a way for me to know when people are struggling. 

Every semester, there are cases where someone stops showing up, and it turns out something in their life went really wrong--I need to know so that we don't miss withdrawal deadlines, etc.--so look at it as a way for me to get to know you and to keep an eye out for people who may be struggling. --> 

---

### Learning environment

Learning from each other is only possible if we show the respect due to our fellow citizens of this class.

<!--

</font>

---

--> 

To realize these goals, I expect us to respect our colleagues and cultivate inclusive discussions. This means that we must be careful not to mislead, degrade, interrupt someone who does not speak as much, or enforce hierarchies based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender expression, sexual orientation, or ability.

---

## Basis for Assessment

Credit hours will be earned by attending two classes of 1.25 hours each, reading and preparing written work outside of class for 6 to 9 hours per week, submitting three policy memos, and round table presentations.  

---

---

### Agenda setting issues memo 5% 

The first assignment is your opportunity to set the agenda for this course. It is also a chance to learn about how political authority is distributed in the U.S. federal system. 

Please submit a 1 page memo on the following question: 

What are the most pressing water quality issues in the Great Lakes region? Please identify three issues and three local, state, inter-state, tribal, inter-tribal, or U.S. federal officials who are in a position to advance policies addressing each issue.

---

### Policy memoranda (3 X 20% = 60%)

You will write three policy memos to public officials following [the memo template](https://judgelord.github.io/PS510/memos.html) exactly.

---

### Roundtable 15% (+5% peer reviews)

The last three class periods are reserved for you to present your policy recommendations on an expert panel. You will have about 10 minutes to present and answer questions. 

You will closely observe and comment on your peers' presentations, writing a one-page peer critique for each of the other five panels.  

---

### Grades 

Your GSI and I will comment on your memos (click on the "rubric" button to see our comments). I expect you to take our comments into account in your next memo and write more effectively each time. If our comments are unclear, please come to office hours.

Assignments must be submitted on time. Grades will be reduced by a full grade after the deadline and an additional grade per 24-hour period for which the assignment is late.

<!--
A: 94-100  
A-: 90-93  
B+: 87-89

### Policy on Academic Dishonesty/Plagiarism

Academic dishonesty is broadly defined as submitting work that is not your own without attribution. This is not acceptable in any academic course. I use software tools to detect plagiarism. If you submit written work containing plagiarized material, you will receive a failing grade for the course and be reported to the University.

---

### Generative Text Tools Using [SALAMI](https://blog.quintarelli.it/2019/11/lets-forget-the-term-ai-lets-call-them-systematic-approaches-to-learning-algorithms-and-machine-inferences-salami/) 

You learn by doing work and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing assignments, but you must learn the craft of policy writing to get credit for this class. To add value to a future employer, you must craft policy recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking an LLM. I expect the same. 

Good policy rests on good evidence. Many LLMs may fabricate evidence. If you turn in work with fake sources or made-up facts, it will get a 0 for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make your work worse than worthless. The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is that you craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to use only those sources. You will still have significant work to do to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and then making sure it is used and cited correctly. 

I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of writing policy memos or learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained.

## Reading

You are expected to do all assigned readings for each week before Tuesday’s class. I will call on students during class.

Each week, we will read some original research and portions of a book for a broader context. 

<!-- Day calculator: http://wcaleb.rice.edu/syllabusmaker/classes/ -->

## Advice from my previous students

- Understand federalism and the structure of local government. (Hint: the readings help!)
- Start early on policy memos and come to office hours. 
- Policy memos are short but not easy!
- Memos take a lot of research. 
- It is key to understand basic public policy and political science concepts. Please stop me for clarification anytime.

## Academic Integrity

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in the Ford School's community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. 

---

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities are a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to inform me of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized.
