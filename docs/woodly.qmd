> Political conflict is not like an intercollegiate debate in which the opponents agree in advance on a definition of the issues. As a matter of fact, the definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power; antagonists can rarely agree on what the issues are because power is involved in the definition. 

> He who determines what politics is about runs the country, because the definition of alternatives is the choice of conflicts, and the choice of conflicts allocates power.

-- E. E. Schattschneider, The Semisovereign People (1975)

## Words matter

1) Description implies prescription 

2) Stories allocate blame, moving problems in or out of politics

3) Defining alternatives defines political possibilities

. . . 

> Changing public discourse changes power relations...rewriting the common understandings present in the discursive field upon which political possibilities are considered 

> [An] indispensable resource for political challengers (Woodly, p. 1)


## Politics 

> the principles and policy that are at stake in the struggle over who shall govern and how.

. . . 

> The activity through which relatively large and permanent groups of people determine what they will collectively do, settle how they will live together, and decide their future” (Pitkin 1981, 343).

## Methodological individualism

> Unless we consider the changing and polysemous reality of meaning, social scientists run the risk of treating values and attitudes as antecedent, given and fixed.

## The Living Wage Movement 

> over 120 local ordinances, guaranteeing municipal employees and contractors wage raises 

but

> The public's ideas about the relationship between government, capital, and citizens remained unchanged

## Marriage Equality 

> Judicial and legislative defeats

but

> forcing them to articulate arguments for or against what had previously been **unthinkable**


## Lessons 

Politics as outcome

> There is more to being a successful social movement than winning immediate or direct favorable outcomes 

Discourse as a mechanism of 

> Without a ready-made apparatus of Washington-based interest organizations or routine access to elected officials *must* go through the public sphere...to communicate the definition of the problem they see and the contours of the "common-sense" logic that leads them to their preferred solutions.

(problem definition and analysis)


## Emergence 

> [A] concern *emerges* from a marginal community into the mainstream occurs when the press, officials, and other elites take notice.

. . . 

However,  

> Media gatekeepers and public officials may choose to dismiss or ignore or merely fail to prioritize challengers' claims, and the assertions of grass-roots communities may fall back into the category of "noise." 

## Political acceptance

- covered by the media 
- addressed by elected officials 
- opponents must begin talking about the issue, taking into account the way challengers have framed the debate

It is not the same as political agreement or acceptance of a policy position.

## What we think of as political

> What we think of as political is both *contingent* and *constrained* by common-sense notions

. . . 

>  that develop out of the interactions among our background conceptions of the way the world is....with new ideas, practices, and laws. 



## Perssusion

> Success for social movements hinges on persuading 

> Political persuasion is primarily a public process

## Going public 

> Conflicts are taken into the public arena precisely because someone wants to make certain that the power ratio among the private interests most immediately involved shall not prevail" (Schattschneidcr 1975, p. 37)

## Public meaning 

> the common currency of ideas, logic, and practices that are intelligible to most people most of the time---even those who do not agree with them

- contested in mainstream/popular/public discourse

## How public meaning affects behavior: 

(1) New public meanings make `new possibilities`

> Public speech has power because it can bring new understandings into being, and new understandings precipitate new possibilities for political action.

(2) People care about `how others will interpret` their actions

> People's choices and actions [are] always enabled and constrained by what they understand those choices to signify to others (p. 23)

## Public meanings can change 

> Framing can create shifts...with one set of associations becoming commonsensical and the other left open to (re)definition and contestation.

That is, things that were contested can become common sense, and things that were common sense can become contested. 


## Agenda democracy 

> National political agendas do not merely develop; they are made by and through the
speech and action of officials, elite opinion leaders, news media, interpersonal
interactions, and the organized efforts of grass-roots political challengers.
