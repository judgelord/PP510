# Governing water 

- At what level should which decisions be made (federal, state, local?)  

--

- How should authority be allocated among branches (legislative, executive, judicial) within each level? 

--

- What are the best policy tools for each policy goal? 

--

- On what principle(s) should decisions be made? (welfare/utility maximization? Some type of democracy? National security? Right of first possession?)


<!--
Water is one of many interesting topics that challenge some of the core principles 
-->


<!-- Remember, one of my goals is for you all to see clearly the policy debates and implications of a situation. Let's see what we find in part 1, I hope we can start training your eye like an ecologist trains their eye to see shifts, tensions, and interdependencies in a stream, we want to look at this story as policy analysts. What in this story reveals policy tradeoffs, causes, and consequences? -->

## The Fifth Amendment's "takings clause"


<!-- class comments 

How do you think the government came up with the idea to move people away from their homes? Even with providing money or moving houses, do you think this should have been allowed?


The government assumed the Seaway would be a much bigger success than it was, so I can see how they felt it was justified to ask people to leave.

  It did not seem like a democratic decision at all...This should have been something voted upon by the people already in the area, not just something forced upon them.
