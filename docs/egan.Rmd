# Governing water 

- At what level should which decisions be made (federal, state, local?)  

--

- How should authority be allocated among branches (legislative, executive, judicial) within each level? 

--

- What are the best policy tools for each policy goal? 

--

- On what principle(s) should decisions be made? 
--
(welfare/utility maximization? Some type of democracy? National security? Right of first possession?)


<!--
Water is one of many interesting topics that challenge some of the core principles 
-->


<!-- Remember, one of my goals is for you all to see the policy debates and implications of a situation. Let's see what we find in part 1, I hope we can start training your eye like an ecologist trains their eye to see shifts, tensions, and interdependencies in a stream, we want to look at this story as policy analysts. What in this story reveals policy tradeoffs, causes, and consequences? -->

## The Fifth Amendment's "takings clause"


<!-- class comments 

How do you think the government came up with the idea to move people away from their homes? Even with providing money or moving houses, do you think this should have been allowed?


The government assumed the Seaway would be a much bigger success than it was, so I can see how they felt it was justified to ask people to leave.

  It did not seem like a democratic decision at all...This should have been something voted upon by the people already in the area, not just something forced upon them.

## Who ought to have a say? 

> "Thousands of government bodies---from township boards, to state environmental departments to Native American tribes to federal fishery agencies to the U.S. and Canadian International Joint Commission---have some role in managing the interconnected lakes for the sake of the 50 million people."

---

## Who ought to have what kind of authority?


For example, what kind of rights to water ought to exist? (use rights, property rights?). Who should have these rights? (individuals, companies, municipalities?)

---

## Policy Tools

Funding

---

## Focusing event

> "As late as the 1950s the flames on the oily surface of the water were still viewed as business as usual. But eventually, the public had enough, and when the river was set ablaze in 1969, it turned a nation livid and led to the passage of the Clean Water Act." (Egan, pg. 147)


---

## Baseline shift

"New normal"

> "now it's just average" (Egan, pg. 227)
