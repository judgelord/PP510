--

- On what principle(s) should decisions be made (welfare/utility maximization? Some type of democracy? National security? Right of first possession?)

# Examples from *The Death and Life of the Great Lakes*

<!-- Remember, one of my goals is for you all to see clearly the policy debates and implications of a situation. Let's see what we find in part 1, I hope we can start training your eye like an ecologist trains their eye to see shifts, and tensions and interdependencies in a stream, we want to look at this story as policy analysts. What in this story reveals policy tradeoffs, causes, and consequences. -->

## The Fifth Amendment's "takings clause"

 > About 10 families were subject to eminent domain in order to make way for a new school.  While, of course, they were offered a decent amount of money for their property, they essentially had no choice about whether or not to move.  Considering how insistent the founding fathers were on the rights of property owners, I wonder what they would think of these situations.

<!-- class comments 

How do you think the government came up with the idea to move people away from their homes? Even with providing money or moving houses, do you think this should have been allowed?


The government assumed the Seaway would be a much bigger success than it was, so I can see how they felt it was justified to ask people to leave.

  It did not seem like a democratic decision at all...This should have been something voted upon by the people already in the area, not just something forced upon them.

## What are lakes for? 

That is, what is the *public interest*?

## Who ought to have a say? 

> "thousands of government bodies--from township boards, to state environmental departments to Native American tribes to federal fishery agencies to the US and Canadian International Joint Commission--that have some role in managing the interconnected lakes for the sake of the 50 million people."

---

## Who ought to have what kind of authority?

> "the original idea was to give the bi-national commission authority over the Great Lakes fisheries in a manner that would jeopardize the individual states' rights to act independently within their own waters."

For example, what kind of rights to water ought to exist (use rights, property rights?). Who should have these rights (individuals, companies, municipalities?)
