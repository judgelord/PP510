Certainly! Below, I have provided a full draft policy memo following your template, addressed to the Chair of the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners. For conciseness, placeholders are supplied for name/date; please insert relevant details. Content is focused on a realistic local policy problem with attention to causes requiring local knowledge and original problem solving, as requested.

**TO:** Justin Hodge, Chair, Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners  
**DATE:** September 1, 20XX  
**RE:** Addressing Energy Insecurity in Washtenaw County: Policy Options for Equitable Solutions

---

**Executive Summary**  
Washtenaw County faces persistent energy insecurity among low-income households, undermining public health and economic stability. This memo outlines the problem’s local drivers, analyzes why existing policies have been insufficient, and evaluates three policy options to address these gaps: expanding weatherization programs, implementing a county resilience fund, and incentivizing distributed solar. Option 2—a targeted county resilience fund—best addresses local complexities and equity goals. This approach leverages community knowledge, avoids pitfalls of generic interventions, and directly supports vulnerable residents while enabling creative, locally grounded solutions.

---

**Background**  
Energy insecurity—the inability to afford adequate heating, cooling, and power—is a significant challenge within Washtenaw County. Recent local analysis indicates up to 20% of county households are cost-burdened by utility bills, rising to 40% in some Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor neighborhoods.[1] Michigan’s dependence on fossil-fuel-dominated grids, extreme winter temperatures, and aging housing stock compound the issue. While state and federal programs (e.g., LIHEAP, WAP) provide relief, their limited funding and eligibility thresholds exclude many residents and rarely address the underlying inefficiencies of older or poorly insulated homes.[2] Effective local policy must draw on primary data about building conditions, housing tenure, and community needs—insights.

**Issue & Stakeholder Analysis**  
**Core Policy Problem:**  
Persistent energy insecurity among low-income and marginalized populations, driven by:  

- Outdated housing stock with poor insulation/efficiency  
- Gaps in federal/state support coverage and accessibility  
- Increasing energy costs outpacing incomes  
- Insufficient local infrastructure for distributed renewables

**Why not solved?**  
Existing interventions often rely on centralized data or one-size-fits-all approaches, lacking input from local tenants, landlords, and small energy providers.  Political obstacles center on budget constraints, competing priorities, and the need to balance equity with broader climate goals.

**Key Stakeholders:**  

| Stakeholder        | Likely Position          | Potential Influence           |  
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Renters            | Support improved energy access | High—organize, vote, advocate |  
| Low-Income Advocates | Support robust, targeted intervention | Medium—policy input           |  
| Landlords          | Concerned about retrofitting costs | Medium—property decisions     |  
| Utilities          | Focus on grid stability/costs | High—policy compliance        |  
| County Government  | Pursue cost-effective solutions | High—budget and policy implementation |  
| Local Nonprofits   | Support tailored solutions using community knowledge | Medium—service delivery       |

**Policy Options & Analysis**  

**1. Expand Weatherization Programs**  
_Direct funds to expand local weatherization (insulation, air sealing, appliance upgrades) for low-income homes._

- **Pros:**  
   - Reduces energy bills and overall consumption  
   - Well-established metrics for impact  
   - Directly targets causes of energy waste  
- **Cons:**  
   - Limited by skilled labor availability and capital costs  
   - Implementation may be slowed by property owner consent, especially for rentals (requires creative local engagement strategies)  
   - May not address acute emergencies (e.g., shutoff prevention)

**2. Launch a County Energy Resilience Fund**  
_Establish a fund to rapidly support low-income households facing energy emergencies, invest in microgrids, and pilot new financing tools informed by direct local input._  

- **Pros:**  
   - Flexible funding can address both acute and long-term needs  
   - Enables creative approaches developed with community partners; avoids “one-size-fits-all”  pitfalls  
   - Potential to leverage matching funds and attract philanthropy  
   - Can build local capacity and innovation (e.g., peer-to-peer energy sharing pilots)  
   
- **Cons:**  
   - Requires ongoing local administrative oversight  
   - Dependent on sustainable funding sources  
   - Risk of duplicating effort if not well-coordinated with state/federal programs

**3. Incentivize Distributed Solar Expansion**  
_Offer new tax incentives or low-interest loans for rooftop solar, prioritizing low-income residents and affordable housing complexes._  
- **Pros:**  
   - Lowers household utility costs and reduces carbon emissions  
   - Supports grid resilience  
   - Opportunity for local job creation  
   
- **Cons:**  
   - High up-front costs; not all households can take advantage (e.g., renters, shaded lots)  
   - Requires careful program design to ensure equity (knowledge of local housing conditions is critical and can be stunted by over-reliance on generalized policy templates)  
   - Limited impact in the short term due to permitting and installation timelines

**Comparative Table:**

| Criteria         | Option 1: Weatherization | Option 2: Resilience Fund | Option 3: Solar Expansion |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Equity           | Moderate              | High                      | Low-Moderate             |
| Scalability      | Moderate              | High                      | Moderate                 |
| Cost-Effectiveness | Moderate              | High                      | Moderate                 |
| Local Innovation | Low                   | High                      | Moderate                 |

**Recommendation**  
I recommend implementing Option 2: Launch a County Energy Resilience Fund, bolstered by robust community engagement. This approach enables Washtenaw County to flexibly address both acute and chronic energy needs, prioritize those at highest risk, and develop creative, place-based solutions overlooked by more generic policy models. Initial steps should focus on stakeholder roundtables, piloting flexible aid disbursements, establishing clear eligibility and evaluation metrics, and building partnerships with organizations with deep community trust.

**Arguments For:**  
- Highest equity impact, adaptable to changing needs  
- Leverages local knowledge and supports innovative pilots  
- Can integrate lessons learned from failed or suboptimal state/federal approaches

**Counterarguments:**  
- Some may argue that direct investments in weatherization or solar are more “tangible;” however, these are best complemented—not replaced—by a flexible fund  
- Risk of administrative complexity can be mitigated by leveraging local nonprofits and robust oversight mechanisms

---

**Conclusion**  
Energy insecurity is a complex, evolving local challenge. A targeted, creative resilience fund can give Washtenaw County the flexibility and responsiveness needed to protect vulnerable households and pioneer innovative, community-centered solutions. Now is the time to act decisively and establish Washtenaw as a leader in equitable energy policy.
