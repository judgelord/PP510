# Institutional and Political Reforms

(Powers!)
- create, abolish, or shift authority to make decisions

Note: I filled this in for Bardarch, who simply says: "The number of possibilities is too great to list." Why does Bardach give relatively little attention to this?

# "Best" practices

-> Good ideas from somewhere else

## Free lunches

<!-- Unlike sports, there are often win-win policies. For example, in my first job out of college, I worked for a county government in regulatory affairs. One of the big regulatory issues we faced was from the Clean Water Act--we were a major point source polluter--every time you shower or flush the toilet, that water goes to a wastewater treatment plant that discharges that water somewhere. 

The first free lunch was getting regulators to agree to allow us to plant trees alongside farm fields. This was cheaper and had twice the benefit of water quality, so it was a win-win.

The second thing they did was invest in research and technology. They found a way to turn human waste into this stuff, a high-grade fertilizer--pure phosphorus, which they then sold and made a ton of money for the county.

I remember the head of the wastewater plant was this old, kind of sopranos boss kind of guy. To "prove" that this stuff was safe, he would take a few and eat them like candy.

## Functions 
- setting 
- verifying 
- creating

---

## "Postbureaucratic" management's "core ideas"
- service 
- customer focus
- quality
- incentives 
- creating value
- empowerment

<!-- This all sounds good enough at first blush. A lot of people might like them until you get into specifics. But what would Stone say about each of these?  -->

---

## "New Public Management" 
- The government should provide quality services that citizens value 
- The autonomy of public managers should be increased
- Evaluate and reward for meeting performance targets
- Managers should have the human and technological resources they need
- Appreciate the value of competition and the private sphere

<!-- what would Stone say about each of these?  -->
