Bill of Rights

## Amendment 1

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of *religion*, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of *speech*, or of the *press*; or the right of the people peaceably to *assemble*, and to *petition* the government for a redress of grievances.
