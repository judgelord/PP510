## Clean Water Act (1972)

> 502(12) The term "discharge of a pollutant" and the term "discharge of pollutants" each means (A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, (B) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft.

- *point sources* that discharge to (necessarily "into" or "directly into"?) Waters of the United States require an NPDES permit  
- *nonpoint sources* are covered by separate parts of the act (e.g., watershed plans, grants for farmers to manage runoff)
- "adjacent wetlands" are also covered by separate parts of the act

<!--Safe Drinking Water Act (1974)
- injection wells-->

- The Trump EPA published guidance that all releases of pollutants to groundwater are categorically excluded from the Clean Water Act’s permitting program

- The Supreme Court disagreed 
  - ~~"directly into navigable waters.”~~
  - “the functional equivalent of a direct discharge” 

- Key concepts

  - statutory provision, structure, interpretation
  - interpretive guidance 
  - citizen suit
