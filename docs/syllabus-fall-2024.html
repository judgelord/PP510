<!-- Welcome to Introduction to Public Policy. My aim for today is for you all to be clear about the goals and requirements for this class. If we have time, we will start on the topic of Federalism and the U.S. Constitution. In addition to teaching this class at FGord, I taught a similar class at the University of Wisconsin for 5 years. Each semester we ground our studies in a theme. This semester it will be about water quality/energy issues in the Great Lakes region, especially local watersheds and municipal water infrastructure/energy siting. I chose this because it is important and aligns with my professional policy experience. 

I grew up on a small farm in central Wisconsin, where rainfall and groundwater make all the difference. Did anyone else grow up on a farm? A diary? Does anyone have hogs? 

After college, I worked in local government. Specifically, I worked on regulatory affairs for wastewater treatment facilities. Working in a sewage treatment plant may not sound like the most glamorous work, but we were a major regulated entity, i.e., a major source of pollution, and as such, we were a key stakeholder, which gave me a seat at the table with state and federal agencies in charge of water quality regulations. I helped revise some of those regulations and even wrote pieces of state legislation. 

I went on to do a joint master's in law and environmental science between Yale Law School and Forestry School (Which is really more of a policy school).

Then I went to the UN for a few years. Comparing forestry laws around the world for the Food and Agriculture Organization. The UN does great work, and in some ways is really inspiring, but the slow pace and rampant censorship left me very frustrated, so I came back for my PhD

Five years later, I am working on a book about whether regular people's voices matter in government--that is if policymakers act differently when lots of people are paying attention versus when they are not. I also have major research projects looking at the role of money in politics, which members of Congress really work for behind the scenes, federal budgeting, and forms of non-governmental regulation.

<section id="objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this core course in the MPP curriculum is to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed for effective political analysis of public policy issues and decisions. The course covers conceptual and analytic frameworks for understanding political processes, institutions, stakeholders, contexts, and policy decision-making. In addition, the course builds written and verbal communication skills, emphasizing the ability to convey clear and concise political analyses in a variety of formats, including policy memos.</p>
<p>This section of 510 focuses on the politics of policymaking in the U.S. federal system, with special emphasis on environmental policy. Students will learn how policy agendas are shaped and enacted within and across institutions of local, state, and U.S. federal government, as well as Native nations. We will study the roles of different actors, types of authority, and advocacy strategies and develop skills required to inform and influence policy. We will apply this conceptual understanding to policy challenges related to energy infrastructure in Michigan, <!--water quality in the Great Lakes region, --> which we will use as working examples throughout the semester.</p>
<p>Public policy is defined in many ways. I think of public policy as the government’s statement of what it intends to do. The government part makes it public, and the stated course of action makes it policy. Policy is more than a single decision, it is a statement about how future decisions will be made. Public policy is made at the international, national, state, regional, county, city, and even more local levels and across different types of institutions (legislative, executive, judicial, etc.) at each level.</p>
<p>Learning about public policy—what it is, the legal frameworks within which it is made, the tools available to policymakers, the policymaking process, and how to evaluate public policies—will strengthen your writing, analytical, research, and advocacy skills.</p>
<p>Public policy is inexorably linked to questions of power. Policy emerges from and shapes politics, but it also involves evidence. Political debates define problems, goals, and agendas, but to achieve any goal through policy, evidence about the effects of different policy tools is indispensable. Evidence must come from sources that your audience will trust. Good evidence ought to be convincing to reasonable opponents of one’s policy goals. Good arguments clarify your logic, even to those who may oppose your goals.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Engage with public policy scholars and practitioners</li>
<li>Understand the history and language of policy studies</li>
<li>Understand how scholarly and public debates inform policy</li>
<li>Conduct policy-relevant research</li>
<li>Write for a policy audience</li>

<p>“Practical wisdom includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience” - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Really there are three kinds of knowledge. 
1. Key terms -- I want you to be able to converse with policy scholars and practitioners - talk the talk
2. Practice influencing policy
3. See-through public debates to underlying policy conflicts and see the underlying debates that underly policy conflicts

I think the most interesting questions are those without clear answers, so most of the questions I will ask in class are open--no wrong answers. The same is true for your memos--good research and good arguments, not right or wrong conclusions.

However, standardization is important, so the Final exam will test book knowledge, more on that in a minute.

<p>These selected chapters and other readings are on either on Canvas.</p>
<p>Other readings (e.g., journal articles) are available online, though you may need to access them through the library website. I do not upload these to Canvas because finding material that you have access to through a library is a valuable research skill. Accessing the course readings via the library website is good practice. Your downloads also helps the library and journals know that this content is being used and thus that maintaining access to it is valuable.</p>
<p>If you hit a paywall on a link from the syllabus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look to see if it says <code>(Canvas)</code> next to it. These readings should be in the “files/readings” folder on Canvas. If they are not, please let me know ASAP.<br>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> The Ford School academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. We hold all members of our community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the Ford School promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Plagiarism involves representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates academic integrity and ethical standards will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action. The Ford School’s policy of academic integrity can be found in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuq2jfmbpflm4f2/FINAL%202023%20Masters%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">MPP</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhllbd4vpfr439r/FINAL%202023%20BA%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">BA</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/06x1tzt1e32pjjw/FINAL%202023%20PHD%20Handbook.pdf?dl=0">PhD Program</a> handbooks. Additional information regarding academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and misconduct and their consequences is available at <a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#112">U-M’s academic-policies page</a>.</p>
<!--By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in the Ford School's community of scholars in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest academic integrity standards. Academic misconduct compromises the integrity of the university. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these acts are examples of academic misconduct, which can result in disciplinary action. This includes but is not limited to failure on the assignment/course, disciplinary probation, or suspension. -->
<p><strong>Use of Technology:</strong> Students should follow instructions from their instructor as to acceptable use of technology in the classroom, including laptops, in each course. All course materials (including slides, assignments, handouts, pre-recorded lectures, or recordings of class) are to be considered confidential material and are not to be shared in full or part with anyone outside of the course participants. Likewise, your own personal recording (audio or video) of your classes or office hour sessions is allowed only with the express written permission of your instructor. If you wish to post course materials or photographs/videos of classmates or your instructor to third-party sites (e.g., social media), you must first have informed consent. Without explicit permission from the instructor and in some cases your classmates, the public distribution or posting of any photos, audio/video recordings, or pre-recordings from class, discussion section, or office hours, even if you have permission to record, is not allowed and could be considered academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Please review additional information and policies regarding <a href="https://intranet.fordschool.umich.edu/academic-expectations">academic expectations and resources</a> at the Ford School of Public Policy.</p>

<p><mark>Discussion questions are graded</mark> on a 0-3 scale.</p>
<p>Advice on writing good questions from Professor Rohde:</p>
<p>Questions should model good intellectual practice; that is, not just a one-sentence question, but a few sentences providing some important framing or context. This could include, for example, an explanation of why the question is important (the stakes), an elaboration on the nuances of the question, etc. Reference to specific language in the text(s) is encouraged and quotes are welcome. For material on the syllabus, simply cite the author and page; for materials beyond the syllabus, please include a full reference. Be sure to reflect on the bulk of the readings for the day; i.e., demonstrate that you’ve read all of the assigned material.</p>
<p>Questions should represent two specific types according to the following classification (identify the types in your post):</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification/Comprehension (e.g., What does X mean?)</li>
<li>Analytical/Interpretive (e.g., How does X evidence relate to Y point?)</li>
<li>Synthetic/Evaluative (e.g., Are you convinced by the author’s argument that X)</li>
<li>Connective/Comparative (e.g.&nbsp;How does X’s argument compare to Y’s we read last week?)</li>
<li>Provocative/Argumentative (e.g., Doesn’t evidence X undermine author’s point Y?!)</li>
<li>Applied/Extended (e.g.&nbsp;What light does X point shed upon current problem Y?) If you choose this question, be sure to indicate why or how the comparison is relevant. I.e., don’t use this as a mindless invitation to extend an analysis across policy problems.</li>

<p>Academic dishonesty is broadly defined as submitting work that is not your own without attribution. This is not acceptable in any academic course. I use software tools to detect plagiarism.

<p>You learn by doing work, and I assess your learning by the work you do. You may use tools to help craft your writing, but you must learn the craft of policy writing to succeed in class. To add value to any employer or cause, you must craft policy recommendations that are significantly better than they would get by asking an LLM. I expect the same.</p>
<p>Good policy rests on good evidence. Many LLMs fabricate evidence. Work submitted with <mark>fake sources or made-up facts will get a 0</mark> for similar reasons that other forms of academic dishonesty make your work worse than worthless. The key recommendation of experts studying how students can effectively use LLMs is to craft a solid bibliography first and constrain generative tools to those sources. You will still have to do significant work to make sure that sources are used and cited appropriately, but this is much easier than finding real evidence to replace fake evidence and <em>then</em> making sure it is used and cited correctly. If you use people or tools other than your brain and spelling/grammar checkers to string words together, you should be prepared to comment on what you used it for, what it got right, and what it got wrong.</p>
<p>I am not yet sure if LLMs are a helpful tool for the craft of writing policy memos or learning this craft. I worry that they may constrain creativity by focusing our attention on problems and solutions that already exist and have already been frequently linked in the source material on which the LLMs are trained. Additionally, in many fields, including political science, rich White men are disproportionately the authors of the source texts.

</blockquote>
<p>Blackhawk argues that the examples we hold up as paradigmatic constitutional successes and failures shape the conventional wisdom about how to distribute power. If we look to different examples (e.g., colonialism rather than slavery and Jim Crow), we may arrive at different conclusions about how best to distribute and limit power across institutions. That is, we might advance different policies that empower different sets of institutions depending on what lessons we take from the policy successes and failures we look to in the past.</p>

A post-decision review of big changes in water quality and wetlands protection law as a result of new Justices being appointed to the Supreme Court. These new interpretations (policies) constraining which wetlands and streams federal agencies can regulate under authority delegated in the Clean Water Act and what Congress can do with Commerce Clause authority reflect broader shifts in the distribution of policymaking power across institutions.

Students who choose to drop by for informal meetings are welcome to do so, but there will be no documentation provided. (See above for open-door policy.)</p>
<p>We will choose meeting locations and conduct meetings with student and instructor safety in mind.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all individual meetings between instructors/students will take place at university venues.</p>
<p>We will ensure that all off-campus meetings, trips, or events must engage with course material.</p>
<p>Off-campus meetings will not involve alcohol or take place at locations that serve alcohol. If the class goes out for a meal, it will be at a cafe or restaurant that does not serve alcohol. The location/day/time of any off-campus meetings between the instructor and students will be documented in Google Calendar (or other software).</p>
<p>We, the instructors, will conduct all individual communications using the University platforms of email, Canvas, Slack, or Piazza, with the caveat that we may use non-university platforms set up by students (such as GroupMe) only if they include all students in the class.</p>
<p>There will be no instructor-student private communications on any non-University platforms, such as social media, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.</p>
