# Why do we make laws?  {background-opacity="0.5" background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/6078/6081346983_7a0cd1ecdf_b.jpg"}


- To bind others *and our future selves.* 


# Why do we make laws?  

- To bind others *and our future selves* 
(often critical to solving **collective action problems**)


## Ways to read a constitution

- As political philosophy
- As a historical document 
- As a policy document
- As a structure for policymaking


## The takeaways

- Policy language ranges from slightly to extremely ambiguous

  - including language about the distribution of authority to make policy 
  - ambiguity is often necessary for compromise

. . . 

- The interpretations considered legitimate by those in positions of power can change

  - Old laws are often used to address new* issues 

  *often "newly seen as legitimate issues by those in power"

. . . 

-  The distribution of authority to make policy affects policy outcomes

::: {.notes}
My goal for today is to wrap up our crash course on the US Constitution as the meta-structure of policymaking in the US. That means we are going to be spending more time on some parts, like the commerce clause, than other parts that may be interesting, but less important for understanding the distribution of power to make policy. 

Before we jump in, I want to check if anyone has questions about the syllabus. 

Also, please raise your hand if you have questions while I am talking.


So today is mostly going to unfold with me putting some policy language from the Constitution and asking why this is important 
--  When answering that question, think 
both substantively --- 
What might this enable or constrain? 
---  and structurally ---
How does this allocate decision-making authority :::  who does this empower or disempower? 

The Constitution is just a prominent example of a policy text. I considered assigning a section of the Ann Arbor Code of Ordinances alongside this. I am not an expert in constitutional law or the Ann Arbor Code of Ordinances. I want us to focus on how these policies allocate authority and structure decision-making :::  I'll be asking for examples, but I'm less interested in you all memorizing examples for each clause of the Constitution than being able to think, what does this policy language do? We can read any policy text as a basket of tools and divisions of authority over those tools. I want us to try reading the Constitution like that today. 

I probably have more content than we can get to, and that is fine. This is an exercise in reading policy texts, not a masterclass in constitutional law.

## $\therefore$ The institutional structure of US policymaking

- is contested

- is constantly changing 

- affects policy outcomes


## Separation of powers

<!--The idea is often credited to Montesquieu-->

::: {.notes}

You may have heard this term before, but we'll spend a little time on what those powers are.

This model has been replicated in 
states, 
some cities (though cities vary wildly), 
and in other national governments.

## Separation of powers


### Article III Powers - Judicial  (cont.)


3 - "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."


## Division of powers across branches: values

Article I.2, I.3, and II are rooted in two different kinds of representative democracy.

Article III is rooted in the idea of wise arbitration, extended to include the authority to restrain the democratic branches through **judicial review**, where a court strikes down laws that it decides are **unconstitutional** (see *Marbury v. Madison*). Judicial review makes the courts a **veto point**.

## Division of powers across branches: interaction

- Legislative confirmation of presidential appointees, judicial nominations, treaties, war declariations, etc/

- Legislative delegation 

- Presidential vetoes

- Judicial review and **deference** (e.g., the *Chevron* doctrine)



## Delegation of powers

- From the legislative branch to the executive branch

- From legislative to independent commissions (usually, technically part of the executive, but powers are contested! For example, FERC, FCC, GAO)

- From higher levels of the executive (president, directors) to lower levels of the bureaucracy 

- From the federal government (legislative or executive) to states (occasionally also counties, municipalities, nonprofits, companies)

<!-- for example, contractors fighting a war make key decisions, sub-delegated from the military) -->


## Article IV - States' Relations

1 - **Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each state** 

. . . 

(The courts of one state will enforce laws or judicial decisions of other states)

. . . 

2.1 - Privileges **and** immunities of **individuals**


> A corporation is  “the mere creation of local law” and can “have no legal existence beyond the limits of the sovereignty" (*Paul v. Virginia* 1869)

(but corporations are generally treated as persons in fights over Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment “Privileges **or** Immunities" Clause)

## Article IV - States' Relations (cont.)

2.2 - Extradition Clause

. . .

2.3.1 - Fugitive Slave Clause

>"No person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due."

## Article IV - States' Relations (cont.)

3.1 - New States may be admitted by Congress

. . . 

1905  State of Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, after the [Curtis Act](https://nativeheritageproject.com/2013/08/17/the-curtis-act-of-1898/) claimed to abolish many Native national governments with which the US had treaties.

::: {.notes}
Including

- Cherokee
- Choctaw
- Chickasaw
- Creek (Muscogee)
- Seminole

Oklahoma was then admitted as a white state.

In 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States determined in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the reservations of the Five Tribes, comprising much of Eastern Oklahoma, were never disestablished by Congress and thus are still "Indian Country" for the purposes of criminal law

3.2 - Property Clause

> The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other **Property** belonging to the United States

## Article IV - States' Relations (cont.)


4 - Guarantee Clause

> The United States shall **guarantee** to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against [domestic Violence](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained).

:::{.notes}
During Reconstruction, the Court in Texas v. White posited that the President’s actions in establishing temporary state governments in the defeated Confederate states at the end of the Civil War was justified as an exercise of his powers as Commander in Chief.
Because the power to carry into effect the clause of guaranty is primarily a legislative power, and resides in Congress, however, those arrangements were necessarily provisional

## Article V - Amendment Process

The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by ***the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States***, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.

Read as a policy document, a constitution allocates **authorities** to make, veto, or enforce policy. 

. . . 

The US Constitution and institutions that copy it attempt to separate Legislative, Executive, and Judicial powers. In practice, authorities are often **unclear or contested**.

. . . 

Authorities are **reinterpreted** to meet political demands of the day. For example, Congress has claimed ***commerce clause*** authority to 

- Manage food production and other New Deal programs responding to the Great Depression 
- Prohibit states and businesses from enforcing racial segregation (Civil Rights Act, 1964)
- Allow sexual assault survivors to sue in federal court (VAWA, 1994)<!-- (Violence Against Women Act, 1994), but the Supreme Court struck this portion of the Act--> 
- Incentivize people to have health insurance (ACA, 2010)
