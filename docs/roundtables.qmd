## Overview 

This year, roundtables are structured as expert panel presentations assembled for a Michigan House or Senate Committee informational hearing. Here is a [summary of testimony from a recent informational haring on racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant health](https://stateofreform.com/featured/2023/03/michigan-senate-committee-discusses-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health/) and the [full audio from that committee meeting](https://www.senate.michigan.gov/committeeaudio/2023-2024/Health%20Policy/Health-Policy-03-22-2023_1232PM_28_72.mp3). Given their official positions, these presenters have more time and slightly different goals than your goals, but I hope it is helpful. 

Here is a nice summary of some research on trends in expert hearings by US House committees:

We have six topics on which various committees would like more information and policy analysis to make informed decisions about potential legislation that may end up in front of them. As members of the committee, they have the ability to mark up and shape legislation and then vote to send it out of committee to the full chamber for debate and votes. On some of these issues, they may be considering proposed legislation on some of these topics for many years to come, so they are not only interested in current draft legislation but also a general understanding of the problem and the pros and cons of different policy solutions that might be advanced. 

## Reflection and peer critique 

For every roundtable in which you will not be presenting, you will be assigned a
person to critique (5 total). Each should be three paragraphs (about half a page, no more than one page) addressing (1) strengths,  (2) opportunities for improvement, and (3) connections to things we studied in this class, especially the Bardach, Blackhawk, Carpenter, Dwidar, Leech, Seifter, Stone, Woodly, Weimer and Vining, and Weaver readings and the Mettler and Nickels podcasts. 

Submit each critique as a seperate file to Canvas by the next class session WITHOUT YOUR
NAME. Do not put your name on the critique. 

Your critique will be graded according to
the thoroughness and helpfulness of the critique. (Don't be mean, but don't hesitate to be
critical. Be clear about what the presenter did well and how
they might improve in the future.)

After three days of presentations, we will have one final day of structured peer critique. I will ask each of you to comment on something from the presentations or answers to questions that you found particularly effective, so please pay close attention to the other presentations and make multiple notes so that we don't get duplicate feedback. 


## Structure

### Opening statements: <mark> 3 minutes </mark> per person

(possibly an additional minute for a clarifying question)

Please coordinate with members of your panel to provide opening statements that do not overlap too much and, instead, add value based on the unique expertise each of you has developed. 

### Questions:  <mark> 20 minutes </mark>

I will likely ask one question from your talking points memo and expect a concise response. 

The class, playing the part of the Committee members, will ask additional questions. Again, responses should be concise. 

 **Ideas for anticipating questions:**

- Give your presentation to (or just talk about your proposal with) others and write down the questions they ask you 
- Gather questions from feedback on your memos and ask yourself if any of them are likely to be asked in response to your presentation
