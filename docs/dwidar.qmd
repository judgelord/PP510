## Background

Organizations representing socially and politically marginalized individuals have smaller budgets, memberships, and staff and more-limited advocacy agendas than do private and professional groups.

- Funded by paying membersâ€™ dues, charitable foundations, patrons, and government grant programs, and thus beholden to their preferences

- State- and local-level interest groups largely perpetuate the same biases as national-level groups

## Theory 

Intersectional advocacy is more influential when pursued as part of a coalition effort

- credibility and expertise 
- resources

## Data

475 public comments submitted by 75 interest groups active in national politics representing women, people of color, Native nations, and the poor.

- not-for-profit organizations and Native American tribes, such as the Affordable Housing Centers of America and the Catawba Indian Nation. Advocacy groups and not-for-profit business leagues form the next-largest segment of the sample. Examples include the Asian American Justice Center, the Feminist Majority Foundation, and Immigration Voice.

## Methods 

- intersectional = policy recommendation pertaining to the interests of an intersectionally marginalized population.
  - any population that contained multiply disadvantaged subgroups of marginalized groups.
- coalition = more than one group
- resources = revenue 
- influence = copied text

## Findings


Coalitions help

  - but not larger coalitions 
  - coalitions with more resources
