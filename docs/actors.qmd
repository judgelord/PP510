### The press 

> “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both...And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.” - James Madison (1822)

When newspapers close, voters have less information.

- [Turnout decreases by ~8%](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1078087409351947), [(one additional paper increases turnout by ~.3%, 13% among readers)](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/voting.pdf)
- [Split ticket decreases by ~2%](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/6/1007/5160090)
- [Civic participation decreases](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.762817)
- [Fewer local reporters](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/newspapers/) lead to [fewer candidates and less competitive elections](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1078087419838058?casa_token=M3-Rd_xUuhgAAAAA%3AMouibGXaJDk1CUpD5rdSeWUAjjtAlEl2OtqM0cV-_nFZz02CgYanxv71WAJOcZKvKJaGWTaCv1Ys&), and a [shift in focus from policy and institutions to "city life"](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/damaged-newspapers-damaged-civic-life-how-the-gutting-of-local-newsrooms-has-led-to-a-less-informed-public/)
- Voters in districts with less campaign coverage were less able to evaluate their House incumbent and not as capable of identifying the candidates vying for office as liberal or conservative. They were also less likely to report that they planned to vote in the House election.

## Elite Theory v. Pluralism

**Group theories** of the relationship between political actors and policy outcomes.  *Who Governs?* by Robert A. Dahl vs. *The Power Elite* by C. Wright Mills (building on Max Weber)

- **Pluralism:** Policy results from many groups competing and negotiating with each other in a relatively open political system.

- **Elite theory:** Policy results from negotiations among a relatively closed network of elites--those with high social status (elite educational credentials, wealth, etc.).
- These theories may be stated normatively (policymaking ought to be pluralist) or positively (policymaking is pluralist). 
- Empirically, pluralism focuses more on behavior, elite theory more on structure.
