## Why I like this book 


- Centers interest groups

- Focuses on policy failures--critical to theory and empirically neglected!

- Deep dive into an important policy domain

- Relevant to the survival of millions of species, including ours

::: {.notes}
as Andrea Campbel notes, policy failure is empirically neglected

> "You see, we should utilize natural forces and thus get all of our power. Sunshine is a form of energy, and the winds and the tides are manifestations of energy. Do we use them? Oh no! We burn up wood and coal as renters burn up the front fence for fuel. We live like squatters, not as if we owned the property." — Thomas Edison, 1910

## Stokes brings important questions from the periphery to the core of political science 


> “Electricity pricing is a function of both government policy and interest group privilege; it is not a simple function of economics.” (p. 70). 


> "Conflict rages in legislatures and public utility commissions ... Just because a coal plant is uneconomic does not mean it will close; if utilities have debt and equity in that plant, they will work hard to keep it open."

## Astroturf and conflict expansion 


> "Groups **construct** public opinion both by working with the public and by creating fake public campaigns through astroturfing." (p. 46). 

> “The public is often a **tool** that advocates and opponents use to try to influence decision-makers.”

> “The public’s **voice** can be heard through organizing and activism. Still, in contemporary American policymaking, interest groups’ voices are usually much louder than the public’s. Increasingly, the public is used as a **tool** by interest groups in their battles over policy.”
(p. 66).


## Astroturf and conflict expansion 


> “The opponents relied heavily on fake grassroots campaigns—sometimes called “astroturfing”—while advocates tried to bolster and communicate genuine support from rural and Republican parts of the state. Interest groups on **both sides** aimed to expand the scope of conflict.”

> “Opponent interest groups can simultaneously deploy all of these **direct and indirect** strategies. When **better-resourced** opponents continually attack a policy, policy retrenchment can occur by a thousand cuts. (p. 66)

Hertle-Fernandez & Stokes vs. Schattschneider?!?

This is a question I wrestle with 
- how do we tell them apart 
- do groups use resources to expand conflict -- if so, this goes against Schattschneider!

# Discussion Questions 

## Fog of Enactment  

"opponent interest groups and politicians struggle to predict policies' consequences" (p. 35)

- Novelty
- Ambiguity 
- Technical complexity
- Multiple institutions

## Fog of Enactment  

"In each state, the politics of enacting clean energy laws has been different than the politics of implementation" - (Stokes, p. 105)


- Stokes states that the fog of enactment decreases when we learn how a policy will play out. (Ch. 2, pg. 81). What are the motivations for states to be the first to pass a policy reform?  

> Would we expect federal policymakers to experience less fog relative to their state and local peers due to their greater resources?

- Is there a way to reduce the amount of uncertainty around novel policies? 

- Is it unethical for an interest group to withhold information that would benefit all affected parties in the initial policymaking process? (Weimer and Vining, Ch. 3)

- How do political parties and interest groups amplify or represent the interests of the public to politicians? (Drutman 2015) 


## Veto points 

> “The United States may have institutions that are particularly supportive of political losers’ repeated efforts to dismantle policies” (p.60). 

> “The U.S. federalist system supports this search for new venues to oppose policy through its shared governance across levels of government” (p.62). 

To what extent are the avenues of policy opposition Stokes identifies intentionally designed parts of a federalist system?



. . . 

To what extent is it capitalism? (i.e.. now much should we blame the structure of government vs. the structure of ownership over energy production?)

## Policy Feedback 

Policy makes politics: policy as "terrain" rather than policy as "prize" the explanatory variable rather than the dependent variable. 

- In design: Are there specific actions advocates should take during the implementation stage to increase the likelihood of positive feedback at state and local levels?

- Technology & Policy: It’s tempting to think of technology as separate from politics; indeed, Stokes describes innovation as simply “occurring - or failing to occur" (53). Do interest groups shape technological innovation? Public trust in the technologies? 



## Retrenchment 

Electric utilities “used their privileged position to roll back clean energy laws” (Stokes, p. 107).

>  What lessons from other areas of policy addressing institutional resistance apply to advancing clean energy laws? <!--Amaya-->




> Stokes notes that interest groups’ ability to “shape the parties through primaries is [more] pronounced at the subnational level” (p. 64). Does this mean that retrenchment is more likely to occur for policies passed at a state or local level, as opposed to national policies?


# INSTITUTIONS 

What is an institution?  




## Expertise and Quiet Politics 

> How do we approach policymaking for more dense, technical policy issues such as energy policy, where political authorities defer to whichever interest group can most convincingly portray themselves as subject matter experts? (even if their credibility is unfounded or used to push misinformation).
<!--KATE--> 







 
## Incentives to shape policy  

<!--
> Has the culture around and response to lobbying changed?
--> 

## Incentives as policy tools to shape behavior   


(Also see Stone Chapter 12) 


> Why did energy utilities stop investing in improving technologies? (p. 83) What attempts were made to restart or re-incentivize this behavior? 

> What kind of regulation might change the way utilities behave? 

## Institutionalized power  

> What is a democracy when the interests of the powerful, elite, and money are centered?

> What modern policy tools could release state governments from electric utility regulatory capture? <!--Ann--> 

## Changing institutional powers as a policy tool   

> Why does the power to make policy shift among institutions over time?
What are the implications of moving authority? 

> When it comes to renewable energy projects, who benefits when state law supersedes municipal authority? Are public organizations/public actors "better?"

> Is a return to municipal-controlled utility distribution feasible?

## Lesson-drawing 

> What insights does the history of renewable energy policy provide for other sectors that deal with public goods?

<!--starts on 68-->



# Chapter 4: Policy Feedback Takes Hold   


Networked Advocates Use the Public to Drive Clean Energy Leadership in Texas

<!-- 108-154--> 

## Policy Feedback  

- 1990s - Restructuring creates a window of opportunity 
- 1999 - Advocates get a clean energy target
- 2005 - A Republican whose rural district had benefited from wind energy sponsored a bill to increase the target and state funds for renewable
  - Big Wind was key to passing this bill

## Fog of Enactment  

Fossil fuel companies anticipated costs for new laws, but these costs were uncertain and the industry was not mobilized to oppose them. 

- Thus, clean energy was not yet polarized
- Fossil fuel companies and utilities were distracted by fighting each other over deregulation (the big prize)
- The restructuring bill was complex and technical
- Renewable portfolio standards and efficiency were new
- Renewables were not the main issue in the deregulation debate
- Utilities thought transmission investments might benefit them
- Costs were unclear


## Fog of Enactment  


Environmental advocates saw the future more clearly, in part due to networks with advocates in other states.

## Federalism 

- The Texas grid does not cross state lines to avoid federal regulation 

- No public utility commission until 1975.

- Legislature meets every other year. 


## Insider Lobbying 

Environmental Defense Fund 

- Direct access to Democrats
- Appealed to Republicans using pro-market language
- Helped craft the language for the RPS provision in the final bill
  - included an energy credit trading mechanism


## Public Participation  & "Outside" Lobbying 

Public Citizen 

Advocates used the public to get clean energy laws on the agenda. 
The Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process called for public engagement, testing deliberative polling in 1995. 

Environmental groups shaped and communicated public preferences to push renewable energy onto the agenda during the deregulation debate.



## Deregulation / "Restructuring" 

- Enron (traders), fossil fuel companies (manufacturers), and [rural electric cooperatives](https://www.electriccooporganizing.org/rec101) (non-profit electricity providers) blocked a 1997 attempt 

- Environmental advocates and clean energy companies joined with the fossil fuel industry to support restructuring, succeeding in 1999

Policies can create coalitions with "odd bedfellows." 

- For example, once enacted, the prohibition of alcohol sales was supported by a coalition of bootleggers who had built profitable illicit businesses selling illegal alcohol and religious groups who were morally opposed to alcohol.

# Chapter 5: A Direct Line to Legislators and Regulators 

Fossil Fuel Corporations Undermine Texas's Solar Energy Law




## Structural advantage   

Clean energy opponents did not need to use indirect tools like the parties, the public, or the courts. They had sufficient influence at the Capitol, with the governor, and with regulators.

- "He sits in Senator Fraser's office. There's an empty desk that he uses. [The lobbyist and the legislator's staffer] are extremely close"

After a mere six years, the clean energy industry in Texas could not rival the 100-year-old fossil fuel lobby.

- Renewable energy groups were not invited to the table when the final provisions of the 2005 bill were negotiated. 

. . . 

$\longrightarrow$ failed to achieve "lock-in" (unlike the Affordable Care Act)


## Incumbent industry 

> "It finally began to dawn on teh natural gas guys that wind wa starting to cut into their profits and solar was certainly going to cut into their proffits." 


## Organized combat continues into implementation  

Fights to frame the negative price "problem" 

- transitioning to wind has costs
  - government is "subsidizing" transition and "picking winners"
- transitioning to wind creates jobs 

## Organized combat continues into implementation  


Fights over "legislative intent"

- Opponents made the solar RPS a "target" instead of a "goal" so they could later argue to the PUC that it was not binding. 

- Some Republicans joined renewable advocates in arguing they intended to create a mandatory target

- With the power to arbitrate conflict over policy interpretation, the executive branch gains power during implementation (as do courts)

## Organized combat continues into implementation  

1985 Net Metering law aimed to enable distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar)

- But, the PUC did not enforce the law, and utilities refused to connect small-scale generation


### Retrenchment (i.e., unmaking policy)  

- 2007 law changed "shall" to "may" purchase electricity from customers

### Equilibrium 

- People won't install rooftop solar if it does not pay, and therefore few customers exist for companies


## Retrenchment (i.e., unmaking policy)  

- The 2007 law allowed large energy consumers to opt out of the RPS
  - Swinford intended to neutralize large companies 
  - Fraser opposed it because he wanted to maintain their stakes in opposing clean energy
  - Shifted costs of paying for the transition to retail consumers 

- by 2011, polarization on clean energy at the state and federal levels turned most Republicans into opponents



## Explaining policy failure 

To what extent did these new policies fail to create new politics vs. create politics that were bad for them?

- "interrupted"/“disrupted”/“failure of positive feedback”

or (and?)

- incumbent advantage to **resist** policy change and achieve **retrenchment** through negative feedback 



. . .

>"The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was structured initially and then became amplified through policy feedback processes to support coal production over other values" (Bozzi 2013)

::: {.notes}

Clarification about the theory 

Talk about the relationship between several concepts. Maybe the example shows how they co-occur or are distinct. 

At times, there is positive feedback that empowers the utilities. For example, you noted that Ohio HB6 was able to get through in part because past policies had weakened renewable advocates; this policy would further weaken them, so that seems like positive feedback even while it is also a failure of positive feedback for the renewable policy.

Perhaps this is a matter of semantics.

# Chapter 6: Retrenchment by a Thousand Cuts

Koch Industries and Allies Drive Polarization on Clean Energy in Kansas



## How durable are energy-sector alliances with the right and left? 


Political economy shapes party politics:

> "fossil fuel-dependent utilities and industries worked over several years to erode Republican support for clean energy." (p. 196)

Political/ideological networks also shape the political economy:

> "many important opponents working to undermine Kansas’s clean energy laws came from outside the state, brought into the conflict through right-wing interest group networks. (p. 150). 

. . .

- libertarian defectors on the right? Industry power among liberals? (beyond Democrats with companies or plants in their district)






## Ohio HB 6 


> “The unions got duped because after they supported the legislation, [FirstEnergy Solutions] said we are going to gut the pensions. So I think the Democrats and the labor unions were duped.”  (Stokes, p. 220). 

. . . 

> "In political systems where organized labor was allied with the largest left-wing party and emissions-intensive businesses were allied with the largest right-wing party, a 'double representation' of emissions-intensive economic interests resulted. In these cases, parties on both sides of the ideological spectrum had factions representing the interests of carbon-intensive constituencies" (Mildenberger 2020) 

::: {.notes}

> “Several unions lobbied in support of the bill, given the existing workforce at the nuclear and coal plants. After a decade of attacks on the clean energy laws, there were few clean energy advocates or jobs in the state to contest these opponents. These Democrats would rather side with the utilities and the unions than nurture a new clean economy, even if it meant subsidies for coal. Just six days after the bill was passed, Governor DeWine signed it into law. Despite claiming that they would maintain the union contracts at their plants, FirstEnergy Solutions filed a scheduled update to the bankruptcy proceedings just 12 hours after the final bill passed. In this update, the utility walked back their commitment to union contracts, including pensions." (p. 220)

"[The United States'] institutional terrain advantages political actors with the capacity to work across multiple venues, over extended periods, and in a political environment where coordinated government action is difficult, and strategies of evasion and exit from regulatory constraints are often successful. These capacities are characteristic of organized groups, not individual voters."- Hacker, Hertel-Fernandez, Pierson, and Thelen (2021)
