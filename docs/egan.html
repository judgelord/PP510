# Governing water 

- At what level should which decisions be made (federal, state, local?)  

--

- How should authority be allocated among branches (legislative, executive, judicial) within each level? 

--

- What are the best policy tools for each policy goal? 

--

- On what principle(s) should decisions be made? (welfare/utility maximization? Some type of democracy? National security? Right of first possession?)


&lt;!--
Water is one of many interesting topics that challenge some of the core principles 
--&gt;


&lt;!-- Remember, one of my goals is for you all to see clearly the policy debates and implications of a situation. Let's see what we find in part 1, I hope we can start training your eye like an ecologist trains their eye to see shifts, tensions, and interdependencies in a stream, we want to look at this story as policy analysts. What in this story reveals policy tradeoffs, causes, and consequences? --&gt;

## "Safe"

What is a "**safe** number of organisms that could be discharged per cubic meter of water?"...
--
"The scientists said they couldn't do it" (p. 141)

## Who ought to have a say? 

&gt; "Thousands of government bodies---from township boards, to state environmental departments to Native American tribes to federal fishery agencies to the U.S. and Canadian International Joint Commission---have some role in managing the interconnected lakes for the sake of the 50 million people."

## Federalism, Policy Entrepreneurs, and Agenda setting in building the Erie Canal

- 1807: From prison, Jesse Hawley wrote to the *Genesee Messenger*

- 1817: Clinton, now NY governor, pushes forward as a state project
  - Mocked in the press as "Clinton's Folly"
- 1825: Canal opens

## The Fifth Amendment's "takings clause"


&lt;!-- class comments 

How do you think the government came up with the idea to move people away from their homes? Even with providing money or moving houses, do you think this should have been allowed?


The government assumed the Seaway would be a much bigger success than it was, so I can see how they felt it was justified to ask people to leave.

  It did not seem like a democratic decision at all...This should have been something voted upon by the people already in the area, not just something forced upon them.

## Interests - cities and states

- Ports of Chicago vs. NYC
- Chicago sewage vs. downstream states (Ch. 5)
- Chicago Canal vs. other Great Lakes states (Ch. 5)

## Interests - commercial

&gt; "I've been lobbying 25 years on behalf of industry," said Mark Biel, the executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of Illinois. "I'm pretty good at killing bills and ideas" (p. 183)

---

## Interests - commercial

- Seaway shipping vs. rail (public investments)
- If the seaway is closed, should taxpayers compensate salties? (p. 145)
- Seaway shipping vs. boating (inspections, ps. 208-11)
- Commercial fishing vs. sport fishing (industrial policy)

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries office had "demanded" authorization from the state of Michigan to build fish meal plants

--

&gt; The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries regional office was shuttered in Michigan. (p. 96)

--

&gt; "We created a constituency for the lakes"-Tanner (p. 97)

&gt; "Thousands of government bodies---from township boards, to state environmental departments to Native American tribes to federal fishery agencies to the U.S. and Canadian International Joint Commission---have some role in managing the interconnected lakes for the sake of the 50 million people."

---

## Who ought to have what kind of authority?


For example, what kind of rights to water ought to exist? (use rights, property rights?). Who should have these rights? (individuals, companies, municipalities?)
