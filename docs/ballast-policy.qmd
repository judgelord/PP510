> Towards the end of Chapter 4, Egan discusses how the ballast treatment system requirement for incoming cargo ships won't go into effect until 2021 at the earliest. What progress has been made in implementing that policy?

# Authority, Delegation, & Discretion

- In 1972, Congress overrode President Nixon's **veto** to pass the Clean Water Act, but when the EPA wrote the rules, they exempted waste from vessels (Egan, p. 117-118)  
- In 1990, Congress instructed the U.S. Coast Guard to begin regulating ballast water in overseas ships visiting the Great Lakes (p. 131)

## Citizen suits 

<!--
> Have environmental groups sued the US Government or the EPA to act under the commerce clause to protect Great Lakes Interests and infrastructure?

-->

Conservation groups sued the EPA in 2001 to regulate ballast water and then again claiming that the EPA's 2013 ballast rules failed to require "best available technology" (BAT) as required by CWA ¬ß304(b)(2)

## 2018: The [Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA)](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s140/BILLS-115s140enr.pdf)

First, I searched "ballast water" on  [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/search?documentTypes=Rule&filter=%22ballast%20water%22&postedDateFrom=2020-09-01)

I didn't find any EPA rules, so I searched EPA.gov for "ballast water treatment" https://search.epa.gov/epasearch/?querytext=ballast+water+treatment+&areaname=&areacontacts=&areasearchurl=&typeofsearch=epa&result_template=2col.ftl#/

I discovered

- [requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/vessels-vgp)  to develop new national standards of performance discharges 
- [requires the U.S. Coast Guard](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Prevention-Policy-CG-5P/Commercial-Regulations-Standards-CG-5PS/Office-of-Operating-and-Environmental-Standards-CG-OES/Environmental-Standards/VIDA/) (USCG) to develop   regulations on "testing methods, if any, for ballast water management systems (BWMS) that render organisms nonviable"
- until then, the EPA 2013 Vessel General Permit and the USCG ballast water regulations, including 2015 EPA [guidance](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-08/documents/vesselgeneralpermit-erp.pdf) saying that it is a "low enforcement priority" 
. . .
- repealed the Small Vessel General Permit --- "neither EPA nor the states shall require an NPDES permit for any discharge, other than ballast water, from a small vessel or fishing vessel"

<!--, effective immediately upon enactment of the VIDA."-->

## 2019: **Statutory deadline**  

for EPA to publish rules

## 2020: [draft EPA rule](https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OW-2019-0482-0001) (a regulation)

> under the authority of Clean Water Act Sections 301, 304, 307, 308, 312, and 501 as amended by the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act. 33 U.S.C. 1311, 1314, 1317, 1322, and 1361.

- 28,701 comments!
-  "in coordination with the USCG and interested Governors"
- "streamline the current patchwork of federal, state, and local vessel discharge requirements."
- "procedures for states to follow if they choose to petition EPA to issue an emergency order"
- [Unified Agenda timetable](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/EPA-HQ-OW-2019-0482/unified-agenda), says a Supplemental draft rule is expected in <mark>September 2023</mark> üëÄ 


## 2020: US Department of Energy (DOE) rule ["eliminating unnecessary environmental documentation"](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOE-HQ-2020-0017-0020) for Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) shipping

> updating its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing procedures pertaining to authorizations issued under the Natural Gas Act (NGA)

- 16 comments on the proposed (i.e., draft) rule (a.k.a. NPRM)
- Some commenters complain that ships don't need to assess ballast water impacts
- DOE says its only a few ships, how much harm can they do?  ü§∑ 

## 2022: Coast Gaurd Regulations (a "[policy letter](https://www.regulations.gov/document/USCG-2019-0477-0041)") on *testing* for invasives 

> The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act of 2018 (VIDA), Public Law 115-282, amended Section 312(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1322). Pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1322(p)(6)(D)(ii)), the Coast Guard published a draft policy letter in the Federal Register on July 31, 2019 (84 FR 37330)

- 38 public comments
- no approved test for invasives
- this matters because testing is a legal alternative to treating ballast water under VIDA

## 2020-2021: Canadian regulations on ballast water treatment

- effective 2024, delayed until 2030 for vessels built before 2009

###  In response to Canadian regulations, industry  [petitions the US Federal Maritime Commission](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/03/2022-02186/investigation-into-conditions-created-by-canadian-ballast-water-regulations-in-the-uscanada-great) to retaliate by charging $300,000 each time a Canadian vessel enters any U.S. port.

> Section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 codified in 46 U.S.C. 42101, authorizes the Federal Maritime Commission (Commission) to investigate these conditions and to adopt regulations to ‚Äúadjust or meet general or special conditions unfavorable to shipping in foreign trade‚Äù

## 2022: [US Federal Maritime Commission](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/03/2022-02186/investigation-into-conditions-created-by-canadian-ballast-water-regulations-in-the-uscanada-great) asks for additional public comment, now that regulations might soon be more equal

---

## 2023: [EPA Settles with Shipping Companies over Claims of Clean Water Act Violations](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settles-shipping-companies-over-claims-clean-water-act-violations)

- presumably under the 2013 Vessel General Permit 
- "ballast water discharge, inspection, monitoring, and reporting violations"

---


> In this case, ballast water standards are already on the ‚Äúagenda,‚Äù but there is no urgency to act on the agenda item. Especially when the agency has been mandated to strengthen its standards and there is an existing body of scientific research, why has it taken more than eight years to actually act? Are the obstacles primarily internal to the EPA or are they primarily external political or corporate pressures?
