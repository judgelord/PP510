Bill of Rights  
- Individual rights (Amendments 1-8)  
- Unenumerated powers (9)
- Reserved powers (10)

---

## Amendment 1

&gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of *religion*, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of *speech*, or of the *press*; or the right of the people peaceably to *assemble*, and to *petition* the government for a redress of grievances.

---

## Amendment 2

&gt; "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."

--

&gt; "the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."
